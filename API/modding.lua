local c = circuits

-- Should be placed in circuits = in the node definition
-- Connect is "area", or "behind".
-- (Area will connect to any node next to it. Behind will connect through one node.)
-- Connects is a table of groups (without group:) that the node will connnect to in the network.
-- Storage is for storing the connection(s), options are meta, param1, and param2
-- Don't use meta if this node will be using metadata as well.
-- Param1 and 2 can only be used if they are not used by the engine.
-- on_update is to be a function, params are npos and args.
-- This is called when other nodes in the network update the status, like when they turn it on.
